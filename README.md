# Safenet

## What is Safenet?

We believe in the concept that the feeling of Humanity and a part of being Human is all about helping others in need.Whats more important than being safe and not having to worry about who will be there for you when you are in trouble.SafeNet focuses on public safety which depends on creating a community of safety volunteers and using this community to provide instant assistance to anyone in need of help.

## What are the features that SafeNet offers?

SafeNet's basic user interface is an app where any citizen can sign up as volunteers and they will be verified and on boarded to our community. The App Users can use the app to get help when in danger or feels threatened . The App creates alerts for the nearby Volunteers, the Police and Loved ones of the user. So the nearby volunteers can reach there on time and help the person in trouble. Building a community of people, who are willing to help others in need, is the main goal of this project. We also will also have continuous monitoring of the streets via CCTV and other Outdoor Surveillance Systems and process these live feeds using our 3D RestNet and LSTM to do anomaly detection on these live streams.

Let's help each other and be safe.
